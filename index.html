        I taught my final course in Fall 2019. You can view a <u>video of my last lecture,</u> which was not about computer science.
        Khan Academy now carries <u>algorithms tutorials</u> for which <u>Devin Balkcom</u> and I produced content.
        Are you looking for solutions to exercises and problems in Introduction to Algorithms?
        If you are, then see the <u>frequently asked question and answer</u> below.
        
        If you request solutions from me, I will not respond.
        
        From July 2004 through June 2008, I was the director of the <u>Dartmouth Institute for Writing and Rhetoric.</u>
        I occasionally taught a graduate Computer Science course on how to write papers and how to give talks. I publish a <u>list of usage rules</u> that I required my students to observe.
        
        In 2015, PRI's "The World" ran a <u>story on mentoring women in computer science</u> in which a couple of my students and I were interviewed.
        I was interviewed for the Command Line Heroes podcast "<u>Learning the BASICs.</u>"
        You can also hear me spout off in "<u>Philosophical Trials #7.</u>"
        I talked about writing Introduction to Algorithms in <u>an episode of "Frank Stajano Explains."</u>
        And an <u>interview with a Brazilian vlogger.</u></h3></pre>
    <h1>Introduction to Algorithms</h1>
    <h2>Yes, I am coauthor of Introduction to Algorithms, along with <u>Charles Leiserson, Ron Rivest,</u> br and
        <u>Cliff Stein</u>. For MIT Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a post on their blog about <u>the secret to br
            writing a best-selling textbook.</u>
